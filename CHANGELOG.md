# Changelog

## 0.2.3

- The startup greeting is once per recipient, not once per process: a number in the new `greeted` list in
  `access.json` is never greeted again, so a restart no longer texts the owner or costs a turn. `/linq:access greet`
  empties the list.
- `LINQ_CHANNEL_POLL=0` also silences the startup notification: a tools-only process receives nothing and speaks for
  no number, so it has nothing to announce.

## 0.2.0

- Restructured as installable Claude Code plugin (`/plugin install imessage@linq`)
- Added `/imessage:access` skill for access control (pairing, allowlist, policies)
- Added `/imessage:configure` skill for credential management
- Config stored in `~/.claude/channels/imessage/` (`.env` + `access.json`)
- Fixed react endpoint to match Linq SDK (`/reactions` not `/react`)
- Fixed reaction type `emphasize` (was `emphasis`)
- Webhook server handles EADDRINUSE gracefully
- Startup logic runs independently of webhook
- Legacy fallback for `~/.linq/config.json` with migration warning
- SMS/RCS fallback via `preferred_service` on all outbound messages
- 15 iMessage effects (confetti, fireworks, lasers, slam, gentle, etc.)
- Threaded replies via `reply_to` parameter
- File attachments on reply/send via Linq presigned URL upload
- Inbound photo download to `~/.claude/channels/imessage/inbox/`
- Migrated to `@linqapp/sdk` — no more raw API calls
- Text decorations (bold, italic, strikethrough, underline, shake, explode, etc.)
- Rich link previews via `send_link` tool
- Capability check (`check_capability`) for iMessage/RCS support
- `send` tool now returns `chat_id` and `message_id` for chaining
