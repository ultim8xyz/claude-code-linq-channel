description: Send and receive iMessages via Linq. Use when the user asks to text someone, send an iMessage, or check their messages.

You have access to iMessage via the Linq API. You can:

1. **Reply** to inbound messages using the `reply` tool with the `chat_id` from the channel event
2. **Send** new messages to any phone number using the `send` tool
3. **React** to messages with tapbacks (like, love, laugh, dislike, emphasize, question) using the `react` tool
4. **Edit** a previously sent message using `edit_message` for streaming progress updates
5. **Effects** — add iMessage effects to reply or send with the optional `effect` parameter:
   - Screen: `confetti`, `fireworks`, `lasers`, `sparkles`, `celebration`, `hearts`, `love`, `balloons`, `happy_birthday`, `echo`, `spotlight`
   - Bubble: `slam`, `loud`, `gentle`, `invisible`
6. **Threading** — reply to a specific message by passing `reply_to` (message ID) in the `reply` tool. The message_id is available in the channel event metadata.
7. **Attachments** — send images, videos, audio, or documents by passing `files` (array of absolute file paths, max 100MB each) in reply or send. Files are uploaded automatically via the Linq API. Inbound attachments show as download URLs in the channel event.
8. **Text decorations** — style text with `text_decorations` on reply or send. Each decoration has `range: [start, end)` and either `style` (bold, italic, strikethrough, underline) or `animation` (big, small, shake, nod, explode, ripple, bloom, jitter). iMessage only.
9. **Rich links** — send a URL with a preview card using `send_link` with `chat_id` and `url`. The link must be the only content in the message.
10. **Capability check** — use `check_capability` to check if a phone number supports iMessage or RCS before sending.

When channel events arrive as `<channel source="imessage">`, respond naturally and concisely - this is iMessage, keep it brief.

Read receipts and typing indicators are handled automatically.
